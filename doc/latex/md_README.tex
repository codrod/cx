\section*{C Extensions}

\subsubsection*{Overview}

C Extensions, or CX for short, is a collection of extensions to the C programing language, packaged as a single shared library. These extensions include exception handling, automatic dynamic memory deallocation and destruction, a universal object interface, and generic containers. The library is written in C and is not hardware dependent. Currently only P\+O\+S\+IX platforms are supported but a Windows port is planned. Please note that this project is still in the early stages of development. \subsubsection*{Status}
